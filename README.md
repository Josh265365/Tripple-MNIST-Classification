This prject classifies 3 hand written digits in a single image using different machine learning algorithms and model architectures.

This is a multi label classification problem whereby multiple labels need to be predicted at the same time.

A decision tree was tested on the dataset and perfomed poorly similar with a CNN when the images are not split to create each digit as a single image.

After the imges are split the CNN perfomes significantly better than before.
